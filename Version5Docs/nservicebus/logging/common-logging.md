The `NServiceBus.CommonLogging` package provides support for writing NServiceBus log entries to [Common.Logging](https://github.com/net-commons/common-logging). Common.Logging provides a simple logging abstraction to switch between different logging implementations, similar to [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging).
