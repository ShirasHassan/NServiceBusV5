To prevent sending all incoming messages to the error queue during a major system outage (e.g. when a database or a third-party service is down), the recoverability mechanism allows enabling [automatic rate-limiting](#automatic-rate-limiting). When enabled, NServiceBus detects the outage after a configured number of consecutive failures and automatically switches to rate-limiting mode. In this mode, only one message is attempted to probe if the problem persists. Once a message can be processed correctly, the system automatically switches to regular mode.
