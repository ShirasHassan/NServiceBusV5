Routing topologies are used to control how queues, exchanges, and bindings are created on the RabbitMQ broker. If a routing topology is not specified, the transport will default to the `ConventionalRoutingTopology`.

See the [routing topology documentation](/transports/rabbitmq/routing-topology.md) for further details.
