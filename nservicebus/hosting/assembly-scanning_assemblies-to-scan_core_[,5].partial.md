An "Include a list" approach is used. This proved to be problematic. Many extensions rely on assembly scanning, for example transports and persisters in external NuGet packages. If, at endpoint configuration time, a list of assemblies was generated, and that list did not include extension assemblies, the endpoint would fail at runtime with some unexpected and hard to diagnose behaviors.
