NServiceBus will automatically enable property injection for known types across the supported [dependency injection](/nservicebus/dependency-injection) libraries. Use the `Func` overload of `.ConfigureComponent` to get full control over the injected properties if needed.

A common use case is to set primitive properties on message handlers. Given the below handler:

snippet: PropertyInjectionWithHandler

Setting the properties is done as follows:

snippet: ConfigurePropertyInjectionForHandler


partial: handler
