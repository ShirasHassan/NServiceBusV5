## Enabling

snippet: MailerEnabling

## Usage

### In a Handler

snippet: MailerHandlerUsage

## SmtpClient factory

The default [`SmtpClient`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.smtpclient.aspx) factory uses the following implementation

```cs
new SmtpClient
    {
        EnableSsl = true
    };
```

This results in the `SmtpClient` defaulting to reading its settings from the application config.

To configure a custom `SmtpClient` factory use the following:

### Test/Development SmtpBuilder

For testing and development purposes it can be helpful to route all sent emails to a known directory:

## Attachments

For situations where it might not be practical to send binary data as part of messages the attachment finder can be configured as shown below

snippet: MailerAttachmentFinder

The attachment finder needs to be able to determine the unique attachment identification based on the context passed to the finder.

### Pass an `AttachmentContext` when sending the email

Pass an `AttachmentContext` when calling `SendMail`. The `AttachmentContext` should contain enough information to derive how to find and return the attachments for the email.

## Error handling

Retrying email is difficult because when sending an email to multiple addresses a subset of those addresses may return an error. In this case, re-sending to all addresses would result in some addresses receiving the email multiple times.

### When all addresses fail

When the communication with the mail server cannot be initiated, or the server returns an error that indicates all addresses have failed this exception will bubble up to NServiceBus. This will result in falling back on the standard NServiceBus retry logic.

### When a subset of addresses fail

This will most likely occur when there is a subset of invalid addresses however there cases where the address can fail once and succeed after a retry. Have a look at [SmtpStatusCode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.smtpstatuscode.aspx) for the possible error cases.

In this scenario, it is not valid to retry the message since it would result in the message being resent to all recipients. It is also flawed to resend the verbatim email to the subset of failed addresses as this would effectively exclude them from some of the recipients in the conversation.

So the approach taken is to forward the original message to the failed recipients after prefixing the body with the following text.

```
This message was forwarded due to the original email failing to send
-----Original Message-----
To: XXX
CC: XXX
Sent: XXX
```

While this is a little complex, it achieves the desire of letting the failed recipients receive the email contents while also notifying them that there is a conversation happening with other recipients. It also avoids spamming the other recipients.
